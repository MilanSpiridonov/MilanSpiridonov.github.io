                        eeuw aangelegde dam in de Amstel. De plaats kreeg kort na 1300 stadsrechten, werd in 1345 door
                        het Mirakel van Amsterdam een pelgrimsoord en groeide in de Gouden Eeuw uit tot een van de
                        belangrijkste haven- en handelssteden ter wereld. Een toestroom van buitenlanders uit vooral de
                        Zuidelijke Nederlanden, Duitsland en de Scandinavische landen leidde vanaf het eind van de 16e
                        eeuw tot stadsuitbreidingen, waaronder de laatste grachten van de fortificatie die nu als
                        grachtengordel bekend is en in 2010 is toegevoegd aan de Werelderfgoedlijst van UNESCO. </h4>

                        served by
                        two international airports: Paris–Charles de Gaulle (the second-busiest airport in Europe) and
                        Paris–Orly.[10][11] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23
                        million
                        passengers daily;t is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du
                        Nord
                        is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world, but the busiest located outside Japan, with
                        262
                        million passengers in 2015.[13] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural
                        landmarks: the Louvre remained the most-visited museum in the world with 2,677,504 visitors in
                        2020,
                        despite the long museum closings caused by the COVID-19 virus.</h4>

                        media, tourism and communications.[26] Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest
                        urban economy in Europe[27] and one of the major financial centres in the world. In 2019 it had
                        the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe after Paris[28] and the
                        second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe after Moscow.[29] With Europe's
                        largest concentration of higher education institutions,[30] it includes Imperial College London
                        in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the
                        comprehensive University College London.[31] In 2012, London became the first city to host three

                        book,
                        or which landmarks I was supposed to visid.
                        I was lucky to stumble upon YND, because trough their website I was able to book a hotel at a
                        great
                        price AND read up on things I could do on my trip, according to my needs (I was 22 at the time
                        and
                        mostly wanted to visit the big landmarks, but also get a taste of the London night life. They
                        gave
                        me recommendations on which bars I could visit and which restaurants had the best user rating."

                        I've spend the last 4000 thousand years scouring the Earth in search for the best pasta your weak kind has to offer,
                        and it was only logical for me to visit Italy, but even immortal pasta-demons need a tour-guide, for which 'Your Next Destination' helped me a lot. I managed to book an amazing hotel room with the help of their website and I also read up on the best pasta-restaurants Milano has to offer. At the end of my trip I was extremely delighted with the pasta of the italians and also adored the service YND had to offer.
                        <br> Best booking website I've used in atleast 3000 years!<br>9/10 would recommend, neeeds more pasta."
