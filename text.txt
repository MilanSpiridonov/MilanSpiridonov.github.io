Planning your first visit to Paris?   If so, start with these top 10 attractions and legendary sightseeing destinations.  

These are the historical, cultural, and famous places everyone associates with Paris. 

Don't feel you need to visit all of them in one visit, especially you are here for just a few days.  Several, such as the soaring Eiffel Tower, the gorgeous Seine River, the monumental Arc de Triomphe, and even the gleaming white Sacre Coeur set high on a hilltop, are part of the Paris skyline and easy to spot from many places in the city, whether or not you actually visit.

But do take time to stroll through an iconic neighborhood such as the Latin Quarter or Montmartre.  Relax in the beautiful Luxembourg Garden.  Take sunset cruise along the Seine.

Spend a few moments admiring Notre Dame Cathedral.   Sadly, you can now view only the exterior due to the tragic 2019 fire.  However, if restoration efforts continue on schedule, at least a small part of the magnificent cathedral may be open to the public by 2024.  Many of the cathedral's priceless treasures, such as the stunning 13th century South and North Rose Windows, escaped serious damage, and someday you'll be able to see them again.
